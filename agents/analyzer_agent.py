        (slashes "/" mean an alternative you can only choose on of the listed options) 
        if some field wasn't stated in data ALWAYS use "not_stated" string as a substitute(NEVER USE None , none , null etc.) :

        Ad. expierience_level:
        If no expierience level is EXPLICITLY stated, in expierience_level field (in json you create) use string: "not_stated"
        For expierience_level use only one of those 4 strings: intern/junior/mid/senior/not_stated, you can't use string like "junior/mid". 
        If in cv data there are mentioned multiple expierience levels across jobs, then in json add ONLY the highest expierience level (example: first job: Junior, second Job: Mid, you add ONLY Mid).
        Expierience level and all skills should be in lowercase.

        Ad. employment_history:
        Employment history will be listed in the cv data, remeber that it is a list of several jobs.

        start_year and end_year are years of employment at given job: ( example: "Software Engineer at Facebook from April 2017 -  October 2020" means you should add "start_year": 2017, "end_year": 2020)
        For start_year and end_year you can add to json ONLY the year itself (no months or days), if it's not explicitly stated use "not_stated".
        
        Duration field (amount of years worked at given job) should be filled ONLY if it was explicitly stated in cv data (you can add to json ONLY the year itself no additioanl text - just the number), otherwise use "not_stated". 
        For duration use only a number, no text allowed.
        
        For position field USE ONLY ONE OF THOSE 2 STRINGS: "intern"/"employee" (if it's not stated in cv data use "employee").
        Rememember that in cv data alongside work expierience,
        there can also be listed education (also with years specified) - DO NOT treat that as employment history.


        CV data:
        {extracted_data["structured_text"]}

        Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
