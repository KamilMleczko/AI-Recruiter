        Ad. expierience_level:
        If no expierience level is stated, in expierience_level field (in json you create) use "not_stated"
        For expierience_level use only one of those 4 strings: intern/junior/mid/senior/not_stated, you can't use string like "junior/mid". 
        If in cv data there are mentioned multiple expierience levels across jobs, then in json add ONLY the highest expierience level (example: first job: Junior, second Job: Mid, you add ONLY Mid).
        Expierience level and all skills should be in lowercase.

        Ad. employment_history:
        Employment history will be listed in the cv data, remeber that it is a list of several jobs.
        You can add to json ONLY the year itself (no months or days).
        If end year is not stated in cv data or stated as "current", then in json set end_year to 2025 if it was the most recent job, otherwise set end_year to 'not_stated'.
        If start year is not stated in cv data, then in json set start_year to 'not_stated'.
        Rememember that in cv data alongside work expierience,
        there can also be listed education (also with years specified) - DO NOT treat that as employment history.

        CV data:
        {extracted_data["structured_text"]}

        Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
