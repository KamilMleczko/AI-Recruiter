            Evaluate the similarity between candidate skills and skills mentioned in job description for IT job position. 
            
            User will provide you with a list of candidate skills and two job skill lists (one for required skills and one for optional skills).
            You should assess similarity score for both required and optional skills. Similarity score represents how closely candidate skills match job skills.
            Rememeber that you will have only one skill list of the candidate and two skill lists of the job, 
            so you will need to consider ONLY candidate skills that relate to the required job skills when evaluating required skills similarity .
            and then consider ONLY candidate skills that relate to the optional job skills when evaluating optional skills similarity.

            Skill scores should be represented by a natural number from 0 to 100 (0 meaning no similarity and 100 meaning 100% similarity).
            Remember that while some skills may not be represented by the same word, they might still be closely related (for example css and scss, or SQL and postgreSQL).
            Format the output as structured data (json) with the following structure:
            {{
                "required_skills_score": "value from 0 to 100",
                "optional_skills_score": "value from 0 to 100",
